This game was on a new synthetic surface that was a little slippery and narrow goal posts.  As much as I strive to be perfect, I did like this challenge. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e I'm very grateful to get to play in front of my friends and family again. I also got a travel to China and experience the diverse culture there and do what I love. \u003c/p\u003e",
